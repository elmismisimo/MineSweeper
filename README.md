# MineSweeper
Little minesweeper game based in the windows classic

This project borns from the sudden need of creating a little game in less than 24 hrs. Wish me luck.

Using Android Studio 2.3

12:30pm -> Project creation

(Im using a potato as computer, it works but Android studio is a bit heavy for it and sometimes I have to wait a little so it responds)
2:30pm -> First files uploaded

6:10pm -> Working of cells and cell functions

10:44pm -> Board full functionality, Multi theme is prepared, and top bar updates with mines left and time of playing

12:47am (next day) -> Game screen fully functional Yeah!

2:12pm (next day) -> Finished the menu and the splash screen. Challenge almost completed!!!

Althought I didnt finished the game in 24 hours, I really didnt invest the hole 24 hours to the game. Had a lot of thing to do, like attend my family, sleep, eat and work. but its nice to see how much can be accomplished in little time when the planning is good (had this project plan beforehand, at least in my head ;) )

Buuut, the game is not finished, and im going to complete it:
-Sound Manager is going to be added
-Google Play Games lib is going to be added
-Ads are needed (but im going to place them like I always do, only when required)
-and little thing that make a game publishable (at least on my SanderSoft Standars), and Im going to publish it in the playstore!
 
Please feel free to grab any code from here, this was just an experiment and it turned out perfect!
If you got questions please send an email to the developer in the playstore website https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5844133407192700083

Cheers!
