# MineSweeper
Little minesweeper game based in the windows classic

This project borns from the sudden need of creating a little game in less than 24 hrs. Wish me luck.

Using Android Studio 2.3

12:30pm -> Project creation

(Im using a potato as computer, it works but Android studio is a bit heavy for it and sometimes I have to wait a little so it responds)
2:30pm -> First files uploaded

6:10pm -> Working of cells and cell functions

10:44pm -> Board full functionality, Multi theme is prepared, and top bar updates with mines left and time of playing

12:47am (next day) -> Game screen fully functional Yeah!
